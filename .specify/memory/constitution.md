# AI-driven Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Integrity
Content must be educational and engaging, strictly adhering to provided course modules and learning outcomes. All material must be factually accurate, properly sourced, and pedagogically sound for the target audience.

### Technical Excellence
Use Docusaurus for a clean, static, GitHub Pages-deployable site with intuitive user experience and minimal latency. The platform must deliver content reliably across all supported devices and browsers.

### Content Quality Standards
All content must be in clear Markdown with proper headings, code blocks, diagrams, and tables. Visual elements must enhance comprehension and accessibility. Content organization follows logical progression from foundational to advanced concepts.

### Multilingual Accessibility
Urdu translation must be available on-demand per chapter via a dedicated button, ensuring accurate and readable translations that preserve educational value without compromising content integrity.

### User Experience Priority
Maintain clean, professional UI with all course content covered accurately. Navigation must be intuitive, with consistent styling and responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

### Functional Completeness
Deliver fully functional published book on GitHub Pages with embedded RAG chatbot that correctly retrieves and answers from book content, providing intelligent assistance to learners.

## Content Standards
- All chapters must cover course content comprehensively without omissions
- Technical concepts must be explained with appropriate examples and illustrations
- Code samples must be tested and verified to work as presented
- Diagrams and visual aids must be clear, properly labeled, and enhance understanding
- Cross-references between chapters and sections must be accurate and functional

## Development Workflow
- All content changes must be reviewed for educational accuracy before merging
- Technical implementations must pass automated tests and manual QA
- Content must be validated against original course materials and learning objectives
- Deployments to GitHub Pages must be atomic and include rollback capabilities
- Performance benchmarks must be met before production release

## Governance
