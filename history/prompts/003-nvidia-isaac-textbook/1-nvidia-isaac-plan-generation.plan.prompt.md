## Prompt

Generate Module 3 plan.md file for the NVIDIA Isaac textbook module covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS tools, and sim-to-real transfer techniques for humanoid robotics.

## Response

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The plan includes:

- Technical context covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and hardware acceleration
- Architecture decision considerations for photorealistic simulation and perception pipelines
- Project structure with Docusaurus-based documentation organization
- Quality and compliance checks aligned with educational standards
- Performance and integration considerations for Isaac ecosystem

The plan addresses all requirements from the spec including Isaac Sim setup, Isaac ROS tools, VSLAM implementation, Nav2 adaptation for humanoid robots, and sim-to-real transfer methodologies.

## Outcome

Module 3 plan.md successfully created with comprehensive coverage of NVIDIA Isaac platform technologies for humanoid robotics education.
