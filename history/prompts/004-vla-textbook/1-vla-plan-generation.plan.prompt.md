## Prompt

Generate Module 4 plan.md file for the Vision-Language-Action textbook module covering VLA models, speech recognition systems, and cognitive planning for humanoid robotics.

## Response

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA). The plan includes:

- Technical context covering VLA models, speech recognition, and cognitive planning
- Architecture decision considerations for multimodal AI systems and natural language interfaces
- Project structure with Docusaurus-based documentation organization
- Quality and compliance checks aligned with educational standards
- Performance and integration considerations for voice-to-action systems

The plan addresses all requirements from the spec including VLA model integration, OpenAI Whisper implementation, natural language to ROS 2 action translation, and cognitive planning algorithms for humanoid robot control.

## Outcome

Module 4 plan.md successfully created with comprehensive coverage of Vision-Language-Action technologies for embodied intelligence education.
