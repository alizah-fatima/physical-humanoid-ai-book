## Prompt

Generate Module 2 plan.md file for the Digital Twin textbook module covering Gazebo simulation, URDF/SDF modeling, and Unity integration for humanoid robotics.

## Response

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The plan includes:

- Technical context covering Gazebo simulation, URDF/SDF formats, and Unity integration
- Architecture decision considerations for physics simulation and high-fidelity rendering
- Project structure with Docusaurus-based documentation organization
- Quality and compliance checks aligned with educational standards
- Performance and integration considerations for simulation environments

The plan addresses all requirements from the spec including Gazebo setup, robot description formats, sensor simulation techniques, Unity integration for visualization, and human-robot interaction interfaces.

## Outcome

Module 2 plan.md successfully created with comprehensive coverage of Digital Twin technologies for humanoid robotics education.
